# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

#     ___2__          ___8__
#    /      \        /      \
#    0      _4       7       9
#          /  \
#          3   5
# For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
